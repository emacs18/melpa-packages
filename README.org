This is my own build of some of the packages found at [[https://melpa.org][MELPA]]. These packages are
updated once a few weeks after I review all upstream changes.  I simply don't 
have the time or energy to review all changes.  I review what I can and skim 
the rest.

[[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacelpa][spacelpa]] is a similar archive of "stable" packages used by [[https://spacemacs.org][spacemacs]].
